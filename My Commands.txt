What is the difference between bin and sbin?
/bin This directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or repair it. /sbin Like /bin, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually not executed by normal users. /usr/bin This is the primary directory for executable programs.Apr 11, 2014











 
What is version control(or)Source code mangament ?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
A component of software configuration management, version control, also known as revision control or source control, is the management of changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information.


Git
Git is is a version controlling system /source code/management/software configure mgmt
Git is a distributed version controlling system 
Git is can distributed the data internally with out connecting to server 
What is the difference between tripical version controlling system and distribute version controlling system?
In convestion version controlling a devloper can push his code repository only and he can't share his code to anyone elese he can't work ofline &when he come distribute version controlling he can share his code any one with out the of remote repository

How to install a gitblit ?
First go to gitblit web and download the gitblit {gitblit go windos or linux which you want download } go to download copy the download one past in where you want and exctract their and go to gitblit open data and open defalut properties and open in notepad 'server.httpsPort' & 'server.httpPort' and give the both portnumbes and save.
Then run a command gitblit.cmd 
open a giltbilt repository :give the ip address:give httpsPortnumber in the browser
create a repository 
Take the url and clone repository to the local machine
gitclone : the command will clone the remote repository to your local repository
go to cd "repository name"
git config --global user.name "user name" : it will create the user name
git config --global user.email "username@gmail.com" it will create the emailid
git config -- global push.defalut sample
git config --list => it will show all list of config
if we want cross check that user and email id is create are not :git config --global user.name and gitconfig --global user.email
git add filename : this command helps to include the file to part of work space
git status :it will show that file is in which postion 
git commit : it push the file to local repository
git commit -m"some content" : it push to the local repository 
git push : it push from local repository to remote repository
git rm file name : It deleted the file 
then we have to commit 
git log : we can see all the commited revsion numbers or shavansum 
git checkout shavansum number : it will get back the deleted file
git checkout maste : it will take you to laste one
When ever you clone it defalut enable the master
Git repo structure
repo:/master
branch
tags
 branching:
 git branch name: it will create the branch



 checkout means switch
 git checkout branch name : it will go to branching
 git push origin branch name :it push the branch to remote repository {origin means it push from where you clone the repository with origin you cloned it will admistor}
 git branch -r : it will show you all remote repository branchs
 git branch -a : it will show you all own branches
 git branch -v : it is used for to show the you  commited  branch only with revsion numbers
 git branch -D branch name :it will delete the branch forcefully {we don't merged the branch in to masters}
 git branch -d branch name : it will delete the branh {it delete the branch which are merged}
 git push orgin :branch name : It will delete in remote repository {: delete the remote branch}
 git fetch :  Download objects and refs from another repository

what is build automation ?
Build automation is the process of automating the creation of a software build and the associated processes including: compiling computer source code into binary code, packaging binary code, and running automated tests.
What is mavn life cycle 
verify            :- Downlod the depandent libraries
Compile           :- Compile source code
Test - compile      :- compiles the test code
Test              :-Excute the test code
Package           :- preaper jar/war
Install           :-Copy to local repository(.M2)
Deploy            :-Deploy to remote repository (Nexus/artifactory)
Clean             :- It clean the output  means (It clean our traget Directory )(mvn clean)
Clean is a life cycle it not a phase

 mvn verify:- it download all depandance libry 
Pom.xml is defalut build script for maven

Oreder of mavan repository 
1)appache
2)
3)

Mavenization:-  convert ant projects to mavan project
command : java -jar mavenize version .jar 
Pulging 
Praent and chaild relation 
In parent and chaild relation we copy from parent to chaild (we creat folder or directiorys)in parent package we "pom" insted of "jar"
We have to give the modle in parent pom.xml 
<moudle>A<moudle>
<moudle>B<moudle>
We can run the commands from parent only
If have depencdencies 
If we have two files 'A' and 'B' 
If we want excute 'B' 
If 'B' file is depandancy to 'A' (in this case first excute 'A'and it will excute 'B' )
in case we have to add depandancy  in 'B'pom.xml of 'A'gui it means (goupId,artifactId,veersion)copy all id past in 'B'then save pom.xml
Then excute in parent 


What is jenkins?
Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose. Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies

What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is powerful aplication that allows you to continus integration and continus delivery
Why Jenkins?
jenkins is software that allows the continus integration install in servers
what is contnuous  Integration?
contnuous intergration means the devloper devlope the code and put in a shared repository at regular intervals this concepet ment to remove the problem  of finding later occurence issuesin the build lifecycle
